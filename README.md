# PyLink Example

## EyeLink

You’ll need to download the Eyelink Developers Kit provided by SR Research. To do that, register an account [here](https://www.sr-support.com/).

Note that they moderate the accounts fairly heavily, so it may take 24 hrs+ for the registration to go though. Once you’re registered, you can download the developers kit API ( Windows, Linux, MacOS ). You’ll need that kit to be able to call Eyelink functions from within PsychoPy (otherwise you get an error about missing files). Registering also gives access to a support forum.
